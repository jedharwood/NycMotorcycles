  "pg.home.sect-7.text-3": "Second: because there is no payout until the buyer receives the bike.

You will do better being transparent and credible than trying to conceal material informationthat the buyer - such as if it were you - would wish to know. Japanese have a well-earned reputation for obsessing over details and there's no detail too trivial to include - especially the negatives.

In the past 10 years, art buyers - not just car and motorcycle collectors have been responsible for driving prices ever higher. Think about it. Why spend (invest) $100K for a static sculpture. The symphony of hundreds, thousands of moving parts...motion, contours, aesthetics. Moving scupture. Like collectible cars, motorcycles as sound investment are getting the respect - and promotion - from unlikely places. Art dealers, writers and critics.",
